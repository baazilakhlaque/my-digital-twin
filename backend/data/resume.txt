WORK EXPERIENCE
Qualcomm — Software Engineer Intern May 2025 – Aug 2025
● Built a tool for 5G Modem Test Execution Framework to automate test cases generation & execution at scale.
● Utilized Django backend to persist user test cases, and orchestrate server-side test execution across 100+ devices.
● Decreased debugging time by 50% by authoring backend Python utilities for real-time network diagnostics during test
case creation.
● Improved test cases generation efficiency by 35% by designing & testing scalable REST APIs using FastAPI & Postman.
● Reduced server load by 40% by leveraging React Query for efficient caching, request deduplication & background data
synchronization.
● Collaborated with cross-functional stakeholders for future iteration, usability testing, and pre-production validation.
Horizon Labs – Research Assistant May 2024 – Aug 2024
● Researched on how Latent Diffusion models classify, learn & predict artistic styles from images of Chinese paintings.
● Curated a data set of ~3000 images scraped from MET & Harvard Art Museum APIs by writing Python scripts.
● Enhanced model training efficiency by 30% by developing an image preprocessing technique to standardize training
images using aspect ratios and data normalization.
● Performed image filtering by using OpenAI’s ‘CLIP’ to collect similar Chinese paintings as per the CLIP model,
enhancing dataset precision.
● Led weekly meetings with the Professor to show progress, propose solutions & set up future goals.
University of Rochester – Teaching Assistant of Data Structures and Algorithms Apr 2023 – Present
● Assisted professors teach 200+ students topics including trees, graph algorithms, & dynamic programming in Java.
● Led a weekly lecture review with 20+ students, upskill students with best coding practices & optimizing algorithms.
● Designed weekly material, and lesson plans that average a 90% completion rate.
